<a name="myfootnote1">IOC</a>
>Spring IoC Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application.

>It implents using Factory Pattern.


**Dependency Injection**
> It actually injects an entity outside from the class.And It must be loosely coupled.

> **Three Types of Dependency Injection**
>  - Setter injection
>  - Constructor injection
>  - field injection
> 
> _Field injection is harmful_


**Spring Configuration**
> - Xml based configuration
> - Annotations based configuration
> - Java based configuration

_There is a subtle difference in xml based and annotation based configuration._
